No one in the social media would like you to know about this. Even if you are aware of it , no one will bring it up

In social media, the currency is attention.

In video games, the currency is attention.

In porn, the currency is attention.

In subpar relationships, the currency is attention.

If attention was a currency, how are you spending it?

This could determine everything in your life depending on how deep your attention has been robbed from you.

The only thing worth attending to is your ownself.

Rest all could be fake. Scripted. Out of touch with reality. Could be propaganda. Could be clickbaits. Could be spam. Could be anything.

I am sorry for having stole your attention here in this article.

Pay attention only to your self.
