Let's talk.

I have been suffering and this is my outlet

I don't know what to do with myself. 

Or How to improve myself. 

My life till now has been a single tone.

It has no highs and no lows. 

I think I can describe it as always being at the lowest of all things.

I am not sure. what to improve on.

Not that many things interest me.

I am heavily addicted to porn.

I have high prolactin and gyno.

My bench press is very weak.

My body fat is very high.

My diet has a lot of vegetable oil in it. 

I have no girlfriend. 

I live with my parents. 

I am incapable of driving a car. 

I have severe ADHD. I need heavy medication for it.

I have high blood pressure. I have high heartrate. I have 30% body fat.

Sounds like I am complaining. But nah. That is how I have been living till now. It's just reality.

I have a job. I code.

I am able to code programmes at least. It's a skill that I developed in the lots of free time that I had.

I have built some wealth. Since I live with my parents, my expenses are basically nill. 

I am of age 26 and still a virgin. 

People can scoff at this pathetic loser but let me tell you that I am trying to improve. 

All the above statements is not how I am complaining.

It's just my reality.

I can't change my reality if I don't acknowledge it.

I can't change something that I don't know needs to be changed.

I can't change something if I stwill identify that to myself.

I am writing all these down.

Because I think a mighty change is coming.

A change from within.

And this reality of loser is about to be overturn.

It's not just a dream that this day will come.

It's just that these things take time to change.

Overall, I have been able to change some of them. 

I have started talking to girls on Tinder. I have started going on virtual "dates". Still sexless but anyways, even that is an improvement.

I have started to polish my resume and will be applying for a lot more better job positions.

I have started to plan some solo vacational trips.

I have started going to the gym.

I have started drinking more water and more protein.

I still have orgasms and nightfalls/wet dreams but have not looked at porn for like two weeks. 

I have started to write journals. I have started this blog.

I am documenting how I will become a better person.

But first, I will be accepting the reality or nothing might change.
