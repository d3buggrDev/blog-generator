I have been struggling to look for hobby. 

I think I have finally begin to narrow it down. 

First and foremost. Let's establish what are the parameters of a good hobby.

1) It should be fun. 

2) It should be destressing.

3) It should not cause pain afterwards.

4) It should not cause me to lose my mind in it.
