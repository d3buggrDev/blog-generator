Why do the hard things still feel so hard to do.

I know that I procrastinate a lot and I still give up on 80% of my projects.

Because they are hard. There are too many unknowns.

There is no clear direction and I feel lost. 

This is the hardest thing for me to find a way when there is no clear path.

Which makes me think if there is ever a clear path.

There would always be so many unknowns. 

So many of my desires have no clear path on how I would achieve them.

Facing them all unkowns one by one ... 

Where do I begin? 

What do I do?

All I have this desire to achieve the final goal. And I have no clarity on how to achieve them.

When there is no clarity, I think the project would not finish most likely.

Should I break my desire into steps. Into time gaps. Into progression steps? 

I want all my desires to be completed instantly. 

I want no desire to remain cause all of them are complete. 

I don't have a clear path on achieving them. 

Should I keep trying?

Should I.. 

Or is it a wasted attempted. 

What's the use..!!

If there is no clarity on how to achieve them. 

The moment I have clarity on how to do it, it usually gets done.

There is no stopping me in that moment of clarity. It may last hours or days but it still feels like a moment.

And without that clarity , I am just lost with no clear path on how to achieve whatever I want.

Should I just give up? I am asking this very seriously.

What if you say "Give up" Should I give up then? **Should I listen to someone else on what I should give up on?**

I don't think I will give up if someone tells me to.. so no use asking others. 

The only choice I have got is then to carry on doing what I must to achieve what I must desire.

The only question then is how do I gain that clarity consistently. This is something I must answer myself.

Or I could also ask myself, what should I do to never lose that sense of clarity? Why do I lose my sense of clarity.

Because I rest. I give up after achieving some part of my desire.

There is inconsistent follow through. So I can never rest.. 

I guess then only solution is that I will have to rest only when I die.

As long as  I am alive, I gotta do anything and everything for whatever is important to me.
