We live in a time where more and more conversations can be broadcasted online.

We live in a time where more real time interactions can take place in a conversation.

And yet, what we are seeing is that less of these conversations are becoming less empathetic on social media.

Nobody is willing to see the other side of things especially when there is no reason to do that.

You can easily create your own safe space on social media.

You can choose to follow internet "personalities" that will go to extreme character acting to suit their audience needs.

Their audience would not give them attention if they deviate from this personality they have created. 

They don't even have to be related to these personality.

The more empathetic person is bound to get abused. 

This is because he will relate to that thing thinking it might be a genuine thing. But for a creator it's all "content" really.

It's never not content. Anything that is there on the internet is content. Anything that is there on the TV is content.

It is meant to extract the exact emotion that they want out of you. 

This article is content. Just a self realization check but it's better to be aware than being unconcious about it.

Truth be told. Some of these things on the internet makes me feel that it must be real. Only to find out that it's not. 

We take popular creators at their face values. Every word they say gets to be the defined truth. 

The powerful people hold power with their words. 

Therefore it is more important to have real conversations than to watch/create content. 

Being anonymous gives you this flexibility just a little. But it's more also like people tend to hide behind their identities that they create.

I don't know much about this apart from my observations of the social media. So far, the only thing I want to say is that I would like to stay away from it if only I was not so addicted to it. 

An addicts mind knows what is harmful for it. 

It has a tough time bearing the cost of giving up the addiction. 

Similar thing with the internet. With the relationships that we have formed with the presented personality of a person. 

All the good in the world gets associated with these internet/tv people. And I am envious of it. I want to adopt some of it.

I want to be like them. 

I am envious of other people's success with this. 

Cause my thoughts are not linear. My speech is non linear. I have no propaganda (yet). 

Since there is no propaganda.. There will never be an audience for this post.

It is most likely to be ignored. 

But that's okay. I am doing this for myself. This blog is the log of my journey in life. 

I have done some posts in a blog that I used to write where I did have a propganda. It still recieves some views now and then. 

TBH , it was the most obscure blog post on the subject and yet it shows up on the front page of google search when someone searches it. 

It had a slight propaganda like message for an academic institution.. And that post does well.

I recently heard this from a comedian where he says that comics want attention and for that they want to make you laugh. Models want attention and for that they will lose weight.

What does a blogger need to do to get attention?

I know what the youtuber/streamer can do.. they can create drama. They farm dramas.

Am I feeling holier than though right now?

Am I any better than anyone else? Or is that a low self esteem.

Anyways. Thanks for reaching the end of the post. Have a good day. :)
