There is a box. The box is made of glass. 

So it gives the feeling that everyone should be able to see you. 

The body feels tiny. But not that tiny compared to the box.

It's very dark outside. There is no source of light other than a slight ray in the sky. 

Yet there is enough light to figure out if someone is outside.

The box is small. There is no door or windows. No hinges. 

Just four plain sheets of glass connected to each other to form a jar. 

There is no ground. But there is gravity.

You can make out human like figures in the distance. Walking on sand.

The sand stretches for eternity on what feels like infinite horizon.

You call them out on the top of your lungs. 

You scream. You cry for help. You ask them if they can listen to you..

They are able to listen to you. You can see them nodding.

They want to help but they don't know how. They get disturbed a little seeing you. 

They see you struggling. 

But with the amount of help that they have.. it seems impossible for them to be able to help you.

They can't make you their problem. And thus they all leave.

It's only your problem that you are in the glass box after all. 

They can empathize with your problem. But they can't help. No one till now could.

Thus all hope that they had for you is lost.

Time slows down. Cause you have nothing to compare time to other than your own heart beat.

You check to see what you are.. The body seems weird. 

Unlike the one that you have ever had.

You feel tired and numb.

You check to see what you are wearing. It's plain clothes all in black. With white shoes.

Your pockets are all empty. There is nothing else in that box other than you.

You scream only to be heard and then be ignored.

To them all they would want now is for you to disappear. 

You disappearing would end their own suffering, their own guilt for not being able to help you.

To them, you being alive is a problem.

You can't help then but want to disappear.
